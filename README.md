# MagentoX
New Magento X project to rebuild a resilience, simple, faster, feature rich eCommerce System from Magento 1.x as we really hate the structure of Magento2.x and we will build our own developer loved platform.

## New Features
  - Support **PSR-0** and **PSR-4** autoload by default
  - Support **Composer** so you could use as many library as you want
  - Support **PHP7.2** later on will test on PHP7.3 soon
  - TODO adding new type EAV of **matrix** to support **units calculation** such as 1 meter = 100 center meter then support native range filter etc. As Magento 1 did not support range filter but Magento 2 commerce suppor that we will build a better DB schema for that to support easy convertion and mutiple measurements
  - TODO rebuilding the shell folder to support Symfony Console like Magento 2
  - TODO rebranding this repo away from Magento but keep most of the existing database to allow People swith to this platform easily and all new DB will be provide a different table names to prevent conflict
  - TODO rebuild API faster restful API with OAuth2.0 for all modules
  - TODO someone help rebuild the admin using React/Vue js once we rebuild all backend using API
  - TODO someone help rebuild the frontend using React/Vue js with nodejs to pre-render page
  

## require community developer to contribute if you hate what it is in Magento 2 now and let us make a better one together using all open source code including good stuff from Magento 2 if we find any.
